Hi, I’m **Elijah Miller**—a cybersecurity and IT professional with a **B.S. in Information Technology** focused on Networking and Information Security. I’ve built my skills through real-world experience, hands-on labs, and challenges that kept me learning and improving every step of the way.  

In my role as a **Security Analyst/Helpdesk**, I worked on a mix of IT support and security tasks, like:  
- Setting up and managing **user accounts** for new employees and troubleshooting access issues.  
- Improving **email security** by reducing phishing risks with updated spam filters and policies.  
- Automating tasks with **PowerShell scripting** to save time and improve workflows.  
- Monitoring systems, responding to **security alerts**, and keeping endpoints protected.  
- Supporting day-to-day operations—whether it was troubleshooting, setting up workstations, or monitoring accounts.  

I’ve also spent time building my technical knowledge outside of work:  
- On **TryHackMe**, I tackled **cyber defense rooms** that covered **network security, web penetration testing**, and **ethical hacking**.  
- In **Cisco Packet Tracer Labs**, I configured routers, switches, and protocols like **OSPF** and **EIGRP**, solving network challenges in IPv4 and IPv6 environments.  
- On **LetsDefend**, I practiced working as a SOC analyst by investigating real-world security alerts, such as identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities, malware infections, and suspicious user activity within a SIEM environment.

Beyond IT, I was also a student-athlete, balancing NCAA Division I athletics with academics. As a track and field competitor for The University of Southern Mississippi and The University of Tennessee, I earned recognition such as the **Conference USA Men’s Track Commissioner’s Honor Roll (2020-21, 2021-22)** and the **NCAA Division I Track and Field Coaches Association All-Academic award (2021-22)**. These experiences taught me discipline, time management, and the importance of teamwork—qualities that I bring to every professional challenge I face. 

I’m always looking for ways to grow and improve, whether it’s learning new tools, solving technical challenges, or finding better ways to keep systems secure.
